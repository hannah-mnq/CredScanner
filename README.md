# CredScanner

false information scanner (first project)
<br>
This project tests and verifies short text claims or news using NLP. It classifies the claim as REAL or FAKE and optionally checks for real world sources to verify it.
(Currently working on integrating MongoDB for storing user's input in the database and for training the model in real time experience for better results.)
